# KoboToolbox-PowerQuery-Function

This template includes a Power Query M function to retrieve data from the KoBo Toolbox API in order to return the structure of a survey questionnaire in a table format. Specifically, it retrieves survey assets (i.e., survey, choices, settings from XLS form) and then expands them into a table format that can be analyzed more easily.
